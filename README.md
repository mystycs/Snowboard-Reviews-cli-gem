# SnowboardReviews

This gem will scrape thegoodride.com and get a list of all the snowboards for male and female via JSON, and then allow the user to select and read a review of a snowboard of the users choice.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/snowboard_reviews`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.
